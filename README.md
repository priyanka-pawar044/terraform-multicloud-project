Dynamic Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Deployment using Terraform

🌐 Project Overview:

This project demonstrates the automation of infrastructure provisioning across multiple cloud platforms — AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and DigitalOcean — using Terraform as the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool.
It allows users to dynamically select their preferred cloud provider and automatically deploy compute resources (like virtual machines) with customizable configurations such as instance type, region, and networking.

🚀 Features

✅ Deploy or destroy infrastructure from a single prompt
☁️ Supports AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and DigitalOcean
🔐 Follows IaC best practices (modular code, variable files, .gitignore)
⚙️ Dynamic provider selection based on user input
🛠️ Easily extensible for future cloud integrations

🖥️ Usage

🔧 On Linux/macOS
chmod +x multicloud.sh  
./multicloud.sh

🪟 On Windows (PowerShell)
.\multicloud.ps1

📈 Key Learnings / Outcomes:

Gained hands-on experience with multi-provider Terraform configurations.
Understood cross-cloud resource management and infrastructure portability.
Implemented reusable modular design and version-controlled IaC workflows.
Strengthened understanding of cloud interoperability and cost optimization in hybrid environments.
